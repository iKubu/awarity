LinkedIn awareness bot - "With great power comes great responsibility"

The idea is to target a certain subset of the linkedin population, and then let them think that you/a specific person looked at their profile.  This is a good way of creating awareness of someone's profile, since people are generally very concerned to know who is looking at their profiles.

Getting Started
===============
Populate the secrets.py file with your linkedin developer account info - don't commit this file ever!
